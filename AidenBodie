Welcome! Welcome to City 17. You have chosen, or been chosen to relocate to one of our finest remaining urban centers. 
I thought so much of City 17 that I elected to establish my administration here, in the citadel so thoughtfully provided by our benefactors. 
I've been proud to call City 17 my home. And so, whether you are here to stay, or passing through on your way to parts unknown...
Welcome to City 17, it's safer here.
